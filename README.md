## 1. Create environment

- Install packages by _requirements.txt_
- Run _download.py_ to prepare necessary resources

## 2. Run NMT model

Just run _run.sh_ to launch the model for training or for evaluation. You can try different parameters in _run.sh_. If you want to explore more adjustable parameters, just scan arguments parsing part in _run.py_ and adapt _run.py_
